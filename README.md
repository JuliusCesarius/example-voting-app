Example Voting App
=========

Getting started
---------------

Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview). If you are on Mac or Windows, [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Run in this directory:
```
docker-compose up
```

Architecture
-----

![Architecture diagram](architecture.png)

* A Python webapp which lets you vote between two options
* A Redis queue which collects new votes
* A .NET worker which consumes votes and stores them in…
* A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
* A Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time


Note
----

The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.
